# Turbo-Leafblower
First, make a 200+ Volt DC Leafblower! Using a Steorn Orbo motor.  Then make a Hydrogen Electrolysis powered combustion Turbo Blower! It's only exhaust is Water! Bolt 2 turbo's together, a small &amp; a Big, then build a Combustion Chamber &amp; Piping, to make the small turbo spin the Larger one! Separate the Cold &amp; Hot sides, like in Mercede's Benz race engines! Inject extra Water in the Combusion/Expansion chamber to convert more heat to work and Increase the pressure! And coat the entire Hot side in Ceramics. Add a nozel on the Blower to increase the stream velocity! Goal: Generate a Supersonic Airstream at the tip and illustrate Shock Diamonds!
